The group is on [Fridge's Ship](/Places/Fridge's%20Ship). [Prashap](/Characters/PCs/Prashap) suggests that we might be able to find security footage of whoever blew up the [Lady Finger](/Plot/Lady%20Finger) in the [Infinity Station](/Places/Infinity%20Station/Infinity%20Station) security centre. [Luca](/Characters/PCs/Luca) mentions that there were Gamorrean gangsters at [Fudd Ruckers](/Places/Infinity%20Station/Fudd%20Ruckers) who could be involved. (Is he racist?) He thinks [Toronga](/Characters/NPC/Toronga) was mentioned. We head to the [Crystal Plaza](/Places/Infinity%20Station/Crystal%20Plaza).

[Prashap](/Characters/PCs/Prashap) says the races at the [Crystal Plaza](/Places/Infinity%20Station/Crystal%20Plaza) are pudu and can't be cheated but card sharping is easy. He suggests we pretend he was robbed and wants to go to the security place and ask to see the footage because he can't remember what the person who robbed him looks like.

[Prashap](/Characters/PCs/Prashap) asks [Mishy](/Characters/PCs/Mishy) to shake him up to make it more convincing. He wrangles a protocol droid who listens to his story and calls security. Sec guy calls and asks the video to be checked. Prashap insists he's a big deal in Otoh Gunga and somebody might be trying to assassinate him. He's incredulous but show the video to him anyway. We can't get him to show the dock security and says PS (TODO: check name) private solutions handle the port security. He kindly requests that Prashap fucks off to the port.

For some reason we go to the [Infinity Dome](/Places/Infinity%20Station/Infinity%20Dome) for a good scrap instead. The big melee is being advertised as well as the title fight for 1,000 credits. The melee rewards are the pot of all entry fees. The current champion is Scarkill, a black and white Wookie with one eye. [Fridge](/Characters/PCs/Fridge), [Vyna](/Characters/PCs/Vyna) and [Mishy](/Characters/PCs/Mishy) sign up. [Prashap](/Characters/PCs/Prashap) goads [Luca](/Characters/PCs/Luca) into signing up as well. The entry fee is 10 credits. We decide to let Mishy win.

Melee Rules:

* No blasters
* No tech (explosives, droids, etc.)
* Melee combat only
* No funny business

[Prashap](/Characters/PCs/Prashap) bets 300 credits on [Mishy](/Characters/PCs/Mishy). He then starts telling everyone that [Fridge](/Characters/PCs/Fridge) is the cousin of General Grievous and he's gonna fuck shit up; [Vyna](/Characters/PCs/Vyna) is the person the clones from the clone wars were based off of; [Luca](/Characters/PCs/Luca) is an assassin for the Hutts; [Mishy](/Characters/PCs/Mishy) has ringworm (he does not - this is a lie). This works very well and Mishy gets very long odds.

We go back to [The Market](/Places/Infinity%20Station/The%20Market) to buy melee weapons. [Prashap](/Characters/PCs/Prashap) suggests he should hold onto [The Lightsaber](/Plot/The%20Lightsaber) for the melee but [Luca](/Characters/PCs/Luca) refuses to hand it over. Now we head to the port.

When we get to the docks [Prashap](/Characters/PCs/Prashap) starts being a bitch and says he doesn't want to lie about stuff anymore. [Fridge](/Characters/PCs/Fridge) suggests they just ask for the footage themselves since the ship belongs to them. [Luca](/Characters/PCs/Luca) uses a Jedi mind trick to ask a security guard to take him to the security office instead. It works and he leads the way. We start following from a distance. He takes us to a door that leads into one of the spokes of the station. He says their offices are in the security section, right underneath the Rancor group's. He uses his keycard to let us into the spoke hallway. [Vyna](/Characters/PCs/Vyna) leaves their droid outside as a lookout and we enter the hallway.

[Fridge](/Characters/PCs/Fridge) sprints to the end of the corridor and asks [Prashap](/Characters/PCs/Prashap) to hurry after them. Prashap reaches the door and opens it easily. Prashap says it's a special inspection from Coruscant and [Vyna](/Characters/PCs/Vyna) notices cameras and calls their droid over to jam the cameras. The guard is incredulous but somewhat believes him. He tries to call and ask about it but Vyna shoots the microphone before he can. Prashap tries to deescalate but the guard says that impersonating an official of the republic is way worse than shooting at him. [Mishy](/Characters/PCs/Mishy) walks over to the terminal and starts using it. He sees a list of people who are currently detained. He looks for [Gumala Adeen](/Characters/NPC/Gumala%20Adeen)'s name but doesn't find it. [Luca](/Characters/PCs/Luca) persuades him to let us go and we leave.

We enter an elevator, with buttons for 4 floors: A, 1, 2, 3. We seem to be on the top floor (A). We go to floor 2. We see some prison cells and a bunch of people and people wearing red. We assume that was the Rancor group. We immediately go to floor 3. As we're going down the elevator lights go red and a siren goes off.

The door opens to one human person and a bunch of droids (at least 4). The man yells "Droids!" and they aim at us. [Prashap](/Characters/PCs/Prashap) tries to deescalate again and fails miserably. The man tells the droids to apprehend us. Prashap dives and tries to hide under a desk. He trips over a chair on the way and knocks over a table. He is shot in the leg while jumping. [Fridge](/Characters/PCs/Fridge) and [Vyna](/Characters/PCs/Vyna) take out the droids and [Mishy](/Characters/PCs/Mishy) shoots at the humanoid with his toy mandalorian grappling hook. He offers to let anybody we want out. An Aualish guy in a cell says "come on, let me out" in Huttese. [Luca](/Characters/PCs/Luca) asks for the camera footage. He sits back at the desk and goes through the footage. He says they suspected foul play but didn't see anything - the ship just exploded. Luca asks if there were gammoreans around (sus) and the human says they don't work for us, they work directly for [Quasar Investment Group](/Factions%20and%20Groups/Quasar%20Investment%20Group).

(TODO: missed a while here)

[Prashap](/Characters/PCs/Prashap) threatens the man and asks for the first aid kit. He uses a colto shot to help heal his wound. [Luca](/Characters/PCs/Luca) gets all the security footage off of him and tells him to delete the footage of everything we've done. The Aualish guy in Huttese keeps asking to him out. Prashap asks him if he can help us get in touch with the criminals on the station. He says yes and that he knows "the broker" and he can help us out with a place to lay low. Prashap suggests we let everybody out so they confound the search for us a bit.

We let everybody out and the Aualish guy introduces himself as Dax. He asks if he can get a blaster, picks it up and fires at the guard man. [Luca](/Characters/PCs/Luca) defends the guy, who thanks him. [Mishy](/Characters/PCs/Mishy) makes sure everything's been deleted then Luca slices the console in half. Dax gets pushed out of the elevator by the rest of the crowd as the crowd tries to escape.
