The Twilek [Gumala Adeen](/Characters/NPC/Gumala%20Adeen) has hired us for [The Job](/Plot/The%20Job) - ensuring his safety while we transport [The Artefact](/Plot/The%20Artefact) to Coruscant.

We landed on [The Station](/Places/Infinity%20Station/The%20Station), a space station owned by [Quasar Investment Group](/Factions%20and%20Groups/Quasar%20Investment%20Group). (TODO: Did they own it? Missed part of it.)

[Gumala Adeen](/Characters/NPC/Gumala%20Adeen) went to secure lodging and inform his father of progress.

[Prashap](/Characters/PCs/Prashap) wandered off on his own while everybody else went to the Cantina. [Mishy](/Characters/PCs/Mishy) gets a lot of suspicious looks due to being a wookie and people assume he's here for the arena.

[Prashap](/Characters/PCs/Prashap) wanders around mindlessly and ends up at the casino. He starts gambling and sharks some people who quickly leave.

[Mishy](/Characters/PCs/Mishy) manages to order the a massive meat haunch and begins eating at the bar.

[Vyna](/Characters/PCs/Vyna) and [Fridge](/Characters/PCs/Fridge) are drinking together. They're charged a lot for a drinking apparatus for Fridge who complains but Vyna pays for it all anyway.

[Luca](/Characters/PCs/Luca) sits at the bar and orders a drink and a meal. He overhears someone say something about someone called [Toronga](/Characters/NPC/Toronga). (TODO: What did he hear?)

[Prashap](/Characters/PCs/Prashap) tries to grab a champagne flute while on the way to the high rollers' area and fucks up, smashing it on the floor. The droid leading him there leaves him where he is because of it. He notices a mouse droid thing scurry into a hole. He wanders past the [Infinity Dome](/Places/Infinity%20Station/Infinity%20Dome) and sees a big billboard featuring a fight between a (something big) and a Jawa. He continues on to [Fudd Ruckers](/Places/Infinity%20Station/Fudd%20Ruckers).

Vyna gets their tab.

Prashap pickpockets a 50 credit chip from a random mark as he walks to the bar. He sees another mouse droid cleaning up. Sits next to Mishy and Mishy tries to befriend him.

Alarm goes off suddenly. Bar droids say it's just a fire alarm because there's a fire at the port. Luca notices armed guards and overhears them saying they're going to the port. He gathers everybody and convinces us to go investigate. We take the train to the port.

Partway through the train stops and we're told it's the end of the line by a guard. Prashap manages to convince them to let us walk to the port anyway.

When we get to the station we see maintenance crews working and a hologram police tape sectioning off where the ships are. Huge group of people waiting around with luggage. Security guy with a megaphone is organising the group telling them to form an orderly line to get their luggage.

We look down from an observation deck and notice that the [Lady Finger](/Plot/Lady%20Finger) has exploded and little is left.

Luca guesses a Nemoidian is behind it. We try to investigate and notice a maintenance guy going through a door (missed why that's relevant?). Vyna tries to send their droid through the door to investigate which gets us noticed by a security droid. Luca wanders away trying to distract the droid and slips into the crowd.

The rest of us start trying to open the door. Vyna and Fridge start working on it while Mishy blocks the view. Prashap starts jizzing out on a flute he assembled from his bag to distract the crowd.

Prashap's jizz distracts the security guards and they start following him while he walks away from us. Fridge and Vyna pry the door open, everybody except Prashap enters and Luca closes the door using the force subtly, but Vyna notices (and doesn't say anything).

Prashap is trying to make as much of a scene as possible, yelling that the guards are shooting at us. He fires at some luggage and pretends it's the droids, causing a massive stampede and overwhelms the guards.

In the hallway there's a freight elevator and a few doors. A supply closet and a boiler room. There are office supplies, a mop and some holo wet floor signs in the closet.

We go to the elevator, it has a D floor and U floor button. U is lit up. We hit the D button and it goes down. It opens up to a corridor to the space port. We sneak up and start investigating the wreckage.

Prashap tries to contact us, making our commlinks ring loudly but we get away with it. He tells us he's off to find [Gumala Adeen](/Characters/NPC/Gumala%20Adeen).

Luca figures out where the briefcase might be and finds it in Gumala's quarters. Vyna searches the ship thoroughly but doesn't find much. Mishy manages to alert a droid by ripping out a part of the ship that makes sparks. The droid sprays the sparks, focuses on Mishy then flies off before he can do anything. He goes to find the main group.

Luca notices that the suitcase is very light. Vyna suggests we open it but Luca and Mishy think we should open it later. Fridge is angry but Vyna is convinced. We contain Prashap and let him know that we found the package. He tells us he's going to find Gumala. Prashap wanders past the casino again and is enthralled.

We start trying to open the briefcase as we walk back tot he elevator. Mishy figures out the password "LadyFinger" and opens the case up. There's a pristine silver-hilted lightsaber inside.

[Luca](/Characters/PCs/Luca) seems to have some connection to it - he had a feeling in his chest when he saw it. [Vyna](/Characters/PCs/Vyna) noticed that Luca notices something.
