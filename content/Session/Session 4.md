[Dax](/Characters/NPC/Dax) says we'll get the next elevator together and we decide to go with him to his contact who will fix our GTA stars. [Luca](/Characters/PCs/Luca), [Prashap](/Characters/PCs/Prashap) and [Fridge](/Characters/PCs/Fridge) discuss the merits of killing Dax. We hop onto the elevator without issue.

As the elevator reaches the top floor we see two dead bodies on the floor: a human in a prison jumpsuit and the guard who let us pass.  We plan to use the other prisoners as a distraction. [Vyna](/Characters/PCs/Vyna) sends their droid out to scout the situation. The droid sees guards calling for backup. [Dax](/Characters/NPC/Dax) starts running and we follow him.

As we reach the end of the corridor the door opens and a droid points a blaster at us and tells us to stop. [Dax](/Characters/NPC/Dax) runs past and and [Vyna](/Characters/PCs/Vyna) tries to shove him out of the way, taking a shot to their flank. [Mishy](/Characters/PCs/Mishy) grabs the extra blasters from [Prashap](/Characters/PCs/Prashap) but [Fridge](/Characters/PCs/Fridge) just lines up a shot and headshots the droid from the backline. Prashap loots the body as we continue to follow Dax into the maintenance hall.

We continue down the maintenance hall. [Dax](/Characters/NPC/Dax) seems a little lost but leads us into a hatch that seems to be a sewer with dark green, glowing liquid flowing through. We follow. [Dax](/Characters/NPC/Dax) asks if anybody grabbed his blaster (we didn't). A big fleshy bird bastard flies over our head as we duck and chases Dax. [Prashap](/Characters/PCs/Prashap) starts blasting behind us because everybody else with a gun hesitates. We see the huge creature as Prashap lands a few blaster shots and causes it to fall into the "water" and struggle. Prashap delivers the coup de grace. Mishy realises it's a Mynock.

[Vyna](/Characters/PCs/Vyna) slips into the river. [Luca](/Characters/PCs/Luca) tries to help them and gets pulled in too. [Mishy](/Characters/PCs/Mishy) and [Fridge](/Characters/PCs/Fridge) have booked it. Luca casually force jumps out. Vyna gets pulled underwater and starts thrashing around while their droid searches for them.

Meanwhile [Mishy](/Characters/PCs/Mishy) catches the Mynock as it's feeding on [Dax](/Characters/NPC/Dax)'s skull. Mishy starts trying to wrestle it off him. [Fridge](/Characters/PCs/Fridge) takes a shot and blasts through its wing, making it flee.

[Luca](/Characters/PCs/Luca) senses the creature wrapped around [Vyna](/Characters/PCs/Vyna) and jumps onto it, igniting a red lightsaber and slashes the creature. It roars and lets Vyna free. The tentacled mass of a creature roars and slips away. Vyna says they're in debt to Luca now.

[Mishy](/Characters/PCs/Mishy) yanks [Dax](/Characters/NPC/Dax) to his feet and tears the arms off his jumpsuit to bandage his head. Dax thanks Mishy, who accepts the thanks, not realising that [Fridge](/Characters/PCs/Fridge) actually did the hard work. Mishy hands Dax a blaster as the rest of the group catches up and we continue on.

We see a blue light at the end of the tunnel with caution tape. [Dax](/Characters/NPC/Dax) tells us this is it and knocks on the door. Nothing happens. [Luca](/Characters/PCs/Luca) notices bubbling in the water. [Fridge](/Characters/PCs/Fridge) crashes out and threatens Dax, who is confused more than intimidated. Suddenly, Dax gets pulled in. [Mishy](/Characters/PCs/Mishy) and Luca chase the creature while Fridge tries to open the door. Mishy jumps into the poop river and goes ham on the creature, killing it a lot.

[Mishy](/Characters/PCs/Mishy) drags [Dax](/Characters/NPC/Dax) out of the river and sets him on the walkway. Mishy performs CPR and mouth-to-mouth while [Prashap](/Characters/PCs/Prashap) loots the body. He notices an implant in his skull through the teeth marks. He convinces [Fridge](/Characters/PCs/Fridge) to help extract the implant after [Luca](/Characters/PCs/Luca) refuses and goes off to try to open the door. Fridge fucks up and damages the implant with their vibroknife.

As [Luca](/Characters/PCs/Luca) tries to open the door a camera pops out and the door opens up, ripping the quarantine tape. On the other side of the door we see what appears to be a maintenance room full of old droids. Astromech droids, mouse droids, etc. A silver protocol droid with a black arm approaches us. It introduces itself as R1-ZZ, interpreter for [The Broker](/Characters/NPC/The%20Broker). [Prashap](/Characters/PCs/Prashap) says we're here to see the broker and R1-ZZ leads us to meet him - a Jawa.
