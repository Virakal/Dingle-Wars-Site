They are wearing all black with a skin tight bodysuit and black glass mask covering their entire face. They appear female but they have a robotic, modulated voice that seems androgynous. They use an electrostaff.

They attacked us in [Gumala Adeen](../Gumala%20Adeen)'s penthouse suite at the [Starlight Hotel](/Places/Infinity%20Station/Starlight%20Hotel).

They are after [The Lightsaber](/Plot/The%20Lightsaber) and mentioned that they will get paid for retrieving it. They have security footage of the party (other than [Prashap](/PCs/Prashap)) looting the wreckage of the [Lady Finger](/Plot/Lady%20Finger).
