Mishy is a Wookie nerd with a Mandalorian obsession who let his MandoLARPing get out of hand and joined \[whatever the fuck our party is] to try to live the life he wants to live when his LARP group fell apart after they graduated.

His equipment is completely fake, either being made by himself or modified from merch. His axe was commissioned from a local space blacksmith using several weeks worth of allowance.
