An allegedly ancient Jedi artefact.

The artefact is stored in a briefcase belonging to [Gumala Adeen](/Characters/NPC/Gumala%20Adeen). We managed to open the briefcase in [Session 1](/Session/Session%201) and discovered it's a silver hilted lightsaber.

[Luca](/Characters/PCs/Luca) seems to have some connection to it - he had a feeling in his chest when he saw it. [Vyna](/Characters/PCs/Vyna) noticed that Luca notices something.
